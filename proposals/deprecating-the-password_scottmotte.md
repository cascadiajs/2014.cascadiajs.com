## Abstract

Passwords suck. They are hard to remember, difficult to manage, and are everywhere. We should be evaluating whether password-based authentication is the best form of authentication. I think there is a better way. 

Implemented entirely in JavaScript, I've open sourced something called [Handshake.js](http://github.com/handshakejs). It implements an email/sms only authentication mechanism. It's inspired by two-part authentication, much simpler, and you can implement it in under 30 minutes. 
  
Come see a talk on the security strengths and weaknesses of this fresh approach as well as a live coded demo.
