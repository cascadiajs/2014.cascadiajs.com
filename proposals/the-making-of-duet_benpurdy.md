##Abstract

For one week in September, a field of light appeared in the middle of Portland and transformed an empty lot into the heartbeat of MusicFest Northwest. Through thousands of LEDs, the sculpture reacted to the music from MusicFest artists and the interaction of visitors to the installation via a mobile web app.

This talk will walk through the technical challenges of the project and delve into the software tools and technologies used to create Duet. As a software oriented recap, the talk will focus primarily on webGL, the mobile web app, node.js, and Processing.
