##Abstract

HTML Workers provide a pathway to multi-threaded processing in the browser. They have basic support in all the modern browsers and most mobile devices. However, the actual capabilities of the different browser implementations varying widely and are more poorly documented than most HTML apis.

* What are the actual capabilities of Workers in modern desktop browsers? Mobile phones and tablets? Wearables, Smart TVs, gaming consoles?
* What processing tasks do Workers excel at? Where are they only marginally effective or even detrimental?
* What are the measured performance gains? What are the actual costs of each additional Worker?
* What is an effective cross-browser compatible technique for setting up a parallel processing system with Workers?
* What challenges are there when attempting to debug Workers on various browsers?

This talk will attempt to answer all of these questions while holistically examining the current Worker implementation landscape.
