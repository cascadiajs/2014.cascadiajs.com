##Abstract

Imagine a world where your code automatically tests itself each and every time you deploy.  Where your code can tell if anything broke since the last time you shipped.  Where your deployment environment points out any mistakes you made so you can fix them before a customer calls to complain.

That world exists. And you can get there today.

Drafting unit tests for JavaScript isn’t glamorous, but it will save you time down the road and make your application more robust.  Integrating testing with an existing grunt.js workflow automates the process and makes it that much more useful.
