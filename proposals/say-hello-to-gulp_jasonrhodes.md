## Abstract

The more code we write, the more we rely on a build system to keep us from destroying it. But if you're writing a ton of JavaScript in your project already, why mess around with anything else? gulp lets you write node-style JavaScript&mdash;modules, functions, and streams&mdash;to handle everything about your build. And it's fast. I'll explain how to use gulp, what makes it great, how easy it is to make a "plugin" (hint: it's just node require()), and why you should start gulping immediately.
