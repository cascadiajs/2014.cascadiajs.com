# Mob Programming - Making JS Better Together

## Abstract

This presentation will introduce Mob Programming--a whole-team approach to programming. Mob Programming is about everyone working in the same space, at the same time, on the same thing, on the same computer.

How many times have you needed to ask just a few quick questions to your team members but they aren't around, so you're stuck? Have you ever seen a cool open-source project that has way too much code and documentation to read and learn before you know how to contribute? Have you ever felt unskilled to help with a project?

In this talk I'll break down some of the issues and barriers teams and individuals face in the workplace and in the open-source community that keeps them from being happy and productive JS coders. I will explain what the Mob Programming process is and how it can solve these problems. While Mob Programming, even a beginner could instantly and easily contribute to any project. It can bring teams of programmers together from beginner to expert, to produce amazing code more quickly and efficiently than when apart. I'll talk about daily problems this can solve within teams that work on separate computers in the workplace, and the potential it has to better the open-source community.
I'll finish with practical examples of what this team approach might look like and how it can open the door for greater outreach and opportunities to all JS programmers, expert or beginner.
