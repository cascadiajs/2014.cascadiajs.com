##Abstract

Node-serialport and johnny-five ushered in a new era of accessible robotics for web developers. Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone Black entered the fray shortly thereafter, providing cheap, GPIO-enhanced, node-ready machines. Firefox OS enabled native phone apps in the web tech you know and love. JS hardware options are getting more varied, more advanced, and more exciting, by the day. This talk explores some of the ways you too can get in on the JS hardware movement, and remind you why it's always a great time to be excited about JS.
