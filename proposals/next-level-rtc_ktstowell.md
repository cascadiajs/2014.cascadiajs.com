## Abstract

The conference circuit has been giving fair attention to webRTC and the blessed ways of plug-in free, peer-to-peer communication. As support has been stablizing it's time to start pushing the envelope
of webRTC. More importantly, it's time to start pushing the envelope of our creativity as developers when building webRTC apps.

Imagine using webRTC combined with speech recognition in a conference room setting to dictate control over a project management tool or reporting system; likewise controlling actions in a multiplayer WebGL game. Imagine real time music collaboration or layers of interactivity
as frosting on top of a tasty rtc video cake. There's so much we can do and invent!

### TL;DR
I love webRTC and want to share that enthusiasm in the form of demo-ing next-level webRTC projects. 

### Details
This presentation will demonstrate using media streams and layered (superimposed) interactivity combined with the webRTC specification to bring incredible experiences to users.
