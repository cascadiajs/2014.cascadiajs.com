##Abstract
For the past four years Hulu has been building large-scale client applications for various living room devices (TVs, Consoles, Set-Top Boxes).  One key feature shared by a large number of these platforms has been the ability to run JavaScript code, sometimes within the context of an embedded browser and other times within a stand-alone JavaScript interpreter.

My talk will present the Hulu living room architecture that allows us to quickly ship to new platforms and keep old ones up to date.  Discussion will include our tool sets (Coffeescript, Mocha, Knockout) and the design and technological constraints that brought us to the application we have today.
