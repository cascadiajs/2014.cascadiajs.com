##Abstract

What's different about Node.js as a technology and community from other srever-side stacks that have come and gone?
For those of us who have been through the rapid adoption cycles of Smalltalk, Tcl, Java, .NET, Ruby, and other server-side technologies,
Node.js can seem like another distracting flash-in-the-pan. In this talk, I outline various operations- and programming-level
issues each of these previous technologies ultimately posed, and how Node.js currently skirts nearly all of them and 
proves itself to be a pragmatic, defensible, and production-ready basis for any product or portfolio.
