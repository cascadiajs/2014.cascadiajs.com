##Abstract

As developers we strive (although don't always succeed) to build software that people love to use— so why don't we build APIs that follow the same conventions? In this session we'll examine why current specs for APIs (mainly REST) are antiquated, problematic, needlessly complex, and eventually contribute to bad end-user experiences.

We'll finish with an examination and ideas on how APIs can become better by making them more Humanized (aka HAPI). We might even go so far as to propose that HTTP methods like DELETE and POST need to die— now do we have your attention?

Join us for what is likely to be a lively and heated discussion on the current and future state of web APIs as we know them.

According to legend (aka Mom and Dad) Jim Heising began his software development career on an Apple ][+ before he could read, when he crafted the wildly successful program:

```
10 PRINT "Jim is great"
20 GOTO 10
```

While arguably his career has gone downhill ever since, Jim has had a hell of a lot of fun as a designer, engineer and entreprenuer. As a designer and software engineer, Jim has designed and built a number of successful products ranging from VOIP servers, to industrial control systems, to top-selling mobile apps— he even wrote Perl Jam's first official iPhone app. As an entreprenuer Jim co-founded and took Click Commerce public in 2000, and sold Giant Company Software to Microsoft in 2004. More recently Jim co-founded Red Foundry, Inc. and is currently working on the Internet Of Things (IOT) with http://buglabs.net and http://dweet.io.
