##Abstract

The internet needs more cats. DNS servers are the authority on all
things internet. Therefore, the best DNS server is the one that
resolves everything to cats. This talk is about that.

Do you think DNS is scary/arcane/confusing? Nope! I'll show you how
you can write your own DNS server in less than 200 lines of
JavaScript. With cats. We're going to walk through the basics and find
out how DNS servers work, how you can talk to a DNS server if you're a
browser, and how to talk back to a browser if you are a DNS server.

By the end, you'll know how to what a static IP is, why Wireshark is
the best tool if you want to mess around with the internet, how you
can write your own DNS server and perhaps most importantly, why you
probably shouldn't. And have I mentioned the cats? There will
definitely be cats.
